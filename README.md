Hi, Iâ€™m Gerallt Hayes (@GeralltH). I'm a software developer from South Wales. As well as many programming languages, I'm fluent in Welsh. I graduated with a First Class BSc in Computer Science from the University of South Wales. I am also ITIL 4 certified. 

I have experience programming in many languages such as C#, Java, Angular, and C++. I'm also adept at using tools such as SonarQube, Jira, and Jenkins.

Here is a collection of projects I have worked on in university and in my free time.
